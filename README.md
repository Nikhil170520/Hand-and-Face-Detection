# Hand-and-Face-Detection
Project: Hand and Face Detection Using OpenCV (Haar Cascades)

This project implements real-time hand and face detection using OpenCV's Haar cascade classifiers. Haar cascades, a machine learning-based approach, are used to efficiently detect facial and hand features from images or video streams. The system processes frames in real time, making it suitable for applications such as gesture recognition, security monitoring, and human-computer interaction. The project ensures lightweight and fast detection, leveraging OpenCV's pre-trained XML models for accurate results.
